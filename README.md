# QElement

QElement is an alternative desktop app implementation for
[Element (formerly known as Vector and Riot)](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web)
which uses the Qt Web Engine instead of Electron.

## Supported Features and differences to the Electron version

 - Desktop Notifications just like the Electron version, including sound.
 - A functional system tray icon which just worksâ„¢ (Electron has a very very horrible system tray implementation).
 - Respects your operating system file pickers (KDE, GNOME, whatever) while Electron has Gtk file pickers hardcoded.

## Issues

 - Clicking on the desktop notification may not work depending on your desktop environment.
   Investigation is ongoing, could be Qt bug or not.

## Limitations

 - Native extensions made for the Electron version can't be used in QElement and never will be.
   When using QElement only the JS/WASM OLM implementation for E2E is available.

## TODO

 - Probably show a counter in the notification tray icon, currently just a red circle.
 - Configure web app location.

## Building

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
```

## How to use?

QElement requires the built web app found at the [riot-web](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases) repository.
Currently the location is hardcoded to `/opt/Element/resources/webapp`. The extracted Electron `webapp.asar` works too.
Make sure a `config.json` file is available in the web app root.
